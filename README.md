# Little-Lemon-restaurant-API
Little Lemon's management wants to have an online-based order management system and mobile application. The LittleLemonAPI is the back-end API that allows customers to browse food items, view the item of the day and place orders. Managers are able to update the item of the day and monitor orders and assign deliveries.
